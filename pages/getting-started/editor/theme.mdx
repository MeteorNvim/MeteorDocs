# Theme Switcher
<div align="center">
  <video width="" height="" autoPlay playsInline muted loop>
    <source src="/images/themes.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

## Command
`:Telescope theme_switcher`
or
`<leader>t`

## How to works
When the colorscheme is chosen, it saves that information inside `~/.config/nvim/settings.json` then when neovim is opened again it puts the colorscheme based on the content of that json. [Plugin Repo](https://github.com/MeteorNvim/telescope-theme-switcher)
