  </video>
</div>

## Command
`:Telescope theme_switcher`
or
`<leader>t`

## How to works
When the colorscheme is chosen, it saves that information inside `~/.config/nvim/settings.json` then when neovim is opened again it puts the colorscheme based on the content of that json. [Plugin Repo](https://github.com/MeteorNvim/telescope-theme-switcher)
